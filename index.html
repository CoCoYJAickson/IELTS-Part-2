I think it might be quite difficult because you have to learn how to breathe under water and use the equipment. \n\nHowever, I want to try it because I am very interested in 'marine life'. I want to see the colorful fish and coral reefs with my own eyes. I think it would feel amazing to be 'weightless' under the water. It would be an 'exhilarating' experience and a great way to 'step out of my comfort zone'. I’ve seen many videos of diving, and it looks like a whole new world.",
            advanced: "A water sport that has always been on my 'bucket list' is scuba diving. Ideally, I’d like to head to the Great Barrier Reef to experience its world-renowned biodiversity. \n\nAdmittedly, it's a challenging endeavor that requires formal training and an 'adrenaline-pumping' leap of faith. I’m eager to try it because I’ve always been captivated by the mysteries of the deep sea. The prospect of being 'weightless' while observing vibrant coral reefs and exotic marine species is incredibly alluring. For me, it’s not just about the sport; it’s about the chance to immerse myself in a completely different ecosystem and push the boundaries of my personal comfort zone."

It is a story about a girl who goes back in time to the 1980s. \n\nIt made me laugh because there were many 'hilarious' scenes where the main character tried to make her mother happy using modern ideas. The 'slapstick humor' was very funny. However, the movie was also very emotional at the end. I laughed because the characters were so 'relatable' and the dialogue was very witty. It’s a great film because it makes you laugh first and then makes you think about your love for your parents.",
            advanced: "I’d like to talk about the film 'Hi, Mom', which provided one of the most 'hilarious' yet touching cinematic experiences I’ve ever had. I watched it with my parents during the Lunar New Year holiday a couple of years ago. \n\nThe film’s brilliance lies in its witty dialogue and perfectly timed 'slapstick humor'. The plot, involving time travel to the 80s, created numerous comical 'fish-out-of-water' situations. I found myself laughing uncontrollably at the protagonist's desperate attempts to improve her mother's life. It was an 'emotional rollercoaster'—one moment I was giggling at the 80s nostalgia, and the next, I was deeply moved. It's a rare masterpiece that balances rib-tickling comedy with profound family values."

I delved into this masterpiece last year, and it proved to be an 'immersive' experience. \n\nThe narrative explores the first contact between humanity and a dying alien civilization. What makes it so 'thought-provoking' is the way it blends hardcore physics with profound philosophical questions about human nature. The 'character development' is subtle yet effective, and the sheer scale of the imagination is staggering. It was a genuine 'page-turner' for me; I was constantly surprised by the plot's complexity.

The process was a 'game-changer' for my understanding of the subject. It was not only 'efficient' but also eye-opening to see how technology can assist in synthesizing diverse viewpoints.
