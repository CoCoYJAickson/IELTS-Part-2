            simple: "Actually, to be honest, I have many friends, but if I have to choose the most important one, it would definitely be my friend Leo. We have known each other for about eight years now, which is a very long time. I remember it so clearly because we first met in high school on a very rainy afternoon. I had forgotten my umbrella and I was standing there, looking at the rain. Suddenly, a boy walked up and asked if I wanted to share his umbrella. That was Leo. We realized we both liked the same music and games. Leo is important because he is always there through thick and thin. For example, last year I failed a big exam. I felt like a loser. Leo didn't give me a long speech. Instead, he just came to my house with my favorite bubble tea and we sat in silence for a long time. Then he helped me plan how to study. He is a man of few words, but he is the most reliable person I know. I guess he is more like a brother to me now. I really cherish our friendship because I know he will always stand by me. We still stay in touch every day even though we are in different cities now. I can always count on him for honest advice.",
            advanced: "I’d like to describe Leo, a person I consider a kindred spirit and a cornerstone of my life. Our friendship dates back to a gloomy afternoon eight years ago. I remember the rhythmic sound of heavy rain while I stood stranded at school. Leo, an introverted classmate, approached me and quietly offered to share his umbrella. That simple act of kindness was the catalyst for a bond that has only strengthened over a decade. What makes Leo indispensable is his unwavering support. He is truly a man of few words, yet his actions possess a profound depth. A perfect illustration was during a period of intense self-doubt last year. While many offered cliché encouragement, Leo provided a silent, supportive presence, helping me navigate my academic pressure with practical solutions. Our relationship is built on mutual respect and loyalty. Despite occasional personality clashes, we’ve stayed in touch through every major life transition. He has deeply influenced my perspective on what it means to be a reliable friend. To me, Leo isn't just a companion; he is a pillar of strength who has stood by me through thick and thin. I honestly cannot imagine my journey without his steady influence and invaluable advice."

I’ve known him for five years since I moved to my apartment. At first, I just saw him gardening, but later we became good friends. What we usually do is talk about technology. This sounds strange, but Grandpa Li is very tech-savvy. He even taught me how to edit photos! He also has a green thumb, so I help him water flowers while he tells me stories about his life as a teacher. I think he is interesting because he breaks the stereotype of old people. He is a lifelong learner who always keeps up with the times. For example, he recently learned guitar from YouTube. He is always optimistic and full of curiosity. Whenever I feel stressed, his stories make me feel relaxed. He has so much experience but is never bossy. I really admire his attitude and hope I can be as vibrant as him when I’m old. He is a perfect example of staying curious about the world regardless of age.",
            advanced: "I’d like to describe an extraordinary individual, my neighbor Grandpa Li. Despite being in his late 70s, he is remarkably young at heart and possesses a vitality that puts many younger people to shame. We crossed paths in our building’s garden, and he has since become a mentor to me. What sets him apart is his insatiable curiosity and the fact that he is incredibly tech-savvy. While his peers struggle with gadgets, Grandpa Li experiments with coding and photo editing. Our interactions are a blend of traditional wisdom and modern innovation. I find him immensely interesting because he consistently challenges the negative stereotypes associated with aging. He refuses to be left behind by the rapid pace of society. His sense of humor is infectious, and his stories offer a profound perspective on life. He is down-to-earth yet deeply knowledgeable, offering inspiring advice without being overbearing. Knowing him has been an enlightening experience, as he demonstrates that age is merely a number. He is, without a doubt, the most inspiring senior citizen I’ve ever met, proving that a vibrant mind can remain engaged forever."

            simple: "Actually, to be honest, I’ve heard many traditional stories, but the most interesting one is 'The Legend of the White Snake'. My grandmother used to tell me this story every summer holiday. We would sit in her old wooden chair and she would talk while the sun went down. The story is about a powerful snake spirit who turns into a beautiful woman and falls in love with a kind man named Xu Xian. They are very happy until a mean monk named Fahai tries to separate them because she isn't human. He finally traps her under a pagoda. When I first heard this at age six, I felt very angry and sad. I cried because I thought it was unfair. I couldn't understand why the monk was so mean. Now that I’m older, I realize the story is symbolic. It’s about fighting for love and facing prejudice. It’s a huge part of our cultural heritage and has been passed down for centuries. I guess I will tell this story to my own children in the future, just like my grandma did. It’s a captivating tale that really shows the power of the human spirit.",
            advanced: "I’d like to recount a cornerstone of Chinese folklore known as 'The Legend of the White Snake'. This captivating tale was introduced to me by my grandmother as a bedtime story. I recall being mesmerized by her descriptions of misty rain on the Broken Bridge—a setting that felt almost mythological. The narrative centers on a supernatural romance between a snake spirit and a mortal man. Their forbidden love is met with fierce opposition from a rigid monk who represents the cold weight of tradition. The conflict reaches a tragic climax when the heroine is imprisoned beneath a pagoda. When I first heard this, it struck a deep emotional resonance. As a child, I was heartbroken by the injustice, but as an adult, I appreciate its profound symbolic depth. It explores the tension between individual desire and social boundaries. The White Snake is a symbol of sacrifice and the indomitable spirit. This story has survived for centuries because its moral—that love should transcend boundaries—is universal. It remains an iconic piece of our heritage, continuing to inspire modern adaptations. It’s a powerful reminder to challenge our prejudices."

He is famous for his ground-breaking ideas about electric cars and rockets. I first heard about him when Tesla became popular in China. If I met him, I wouldn't just ask for a photo. I would love to have a coffee and ask how he stays so confident when everyone says his ideas are impossible. I’d also love to see his factory and how the robots work. The reason I want to meet him is that his ambition and resilience are very inspirational. Most people are afraid of failure, but he says 'failure is an option'. That really changed my mindset about my own mistakes. He is a charismatic person who wants to change the world. Even though he is a bit controversial, his work on sustainability is very important for our future. Meeting him would be a dream come true because I want to learn how to think big and tackle difficult challenges in my life. He is a true man of action.",
            advanced: "If given the opportunity to meet any iconic figure, I would choose Elon Musk, the visionary entrepreneur behind Tesla and SpaceX. He is world-renowned for his ground-breaking contributions to renewable energy and space exploration. I’ve been captivated by his career for years, not just because of his wealth, but because of his determination to turn science fiction into reality. If I were to meet him, I’d forgo the typical fan interaction. Instead, I’d love to engage in an insightful discussion regarding the future of civilization and the implications of AI. I’m curious about his resilience during the early days of SpaceX when he was on the brink of bankruptcy. The reason I’m drawn to him is his unique perspective on failure; he treats every setback as a data point. While he is a controversial figure, his charismatic leadership and ability to inspire millions to 'think big' are undeniable. I’d love to witness his daily routine firsthand. Meeting him would be a transformative experience, providing a glimpse into the mind of someone redesigning the world for future generations. His commitment to progress is profoundly inspirational."

I remember it clearly because I felt like I was entering a beautiful painting. The building is low and uses a simple color scheme of black, white, and grey. It looks unique because it combines traditional Chinese gardens with modern shapes. For example, the windows are shaped like diamonds and hexagons. Inside, there is a large courtyard with a pond and rocks. When the sun shines, you see a perfect reflection in the water. It’s used to display ancient art, but the building itself is the best piece of art. I find it interesting because it shows how to keep culture alive using modern design. Most modern buildings look the same, but this museum has a special soul. It feels quiet and peaceful, a great place to escape city life. I spent four hours there taking photos of shadows and light. It really changed my idea of what a museum should look like. It’s a harmonious blend of old and new.",
            advanced: "I’d like to describe the Suzhou Museum, an architectural masterpiece that encapsulates the fusion of traditional Chinese aesthetics and modern minimalist design. Designed by I.M. Pei, it’s located in Suzhou’s historic district. Its departure from conventional museum design is striking; instead of an imposing structure, it features low-rise pavilions that blend into the ancient gardens. The visual impact is sophisticated, utilizing a monochrome palette that creates a timeless feel. Geometric shapes allow natural light to filter into the galleries in a poetic way. One interesting feature is the 'water garden' where the pond acts as a giant mirror. This building is a dialogue between the past and present. I find it fascinating because it manages to be cutting-edge without losing its historical soul. The harmony between sharp modern lines and the soft traditional landscape is breathtaking. Every visit impresses me with the use of light and shadow to create a tranquil atmosphere. It’s a brilliant example of respecting cultural heritage while embracing the future. For anyone interested in design, it is an absolute must-see that offers a profound aesthetic experience."

I was panic-stricken because I hadn't finished my research. My phone only had 15% battery. I could see the red icon and started to have cold sweat.

Usually, I find things in seconds, but that night I had to sift through many websites while my phone warned me about low power. My fingers were shaking.

It was the eve of my final thesis submission when a sudden blackout plunged my apartment into darkness. The silence was deafening. My router was dead, and my laptop’s battery was depleting. I felt a surge of adrenaline—I was panic-stricken. With a deadline at midnight, I relied on my smartphone’s dwindling battery and unstable mobile connection. I had to sift through fragmented info to find specific economic statistics. The contrast between my earlier calm environment and this frantic race was jarring. I remember being hunched over in the pitch-black room, eyes straining against the blue light. I had to filter out irrelevant noise and synthesize data while my battery dropped to 5%. This experience highlighted our total dependency on digital reliability. I had to be extremely resourceful. When I finally submitted the file moments before my phone died, I felt an overwhelming relief.

I was sitting on my sofa eating snacks, and my dad turned on the TV. At first, it just looked like grey rocks and snow. I thought it was boring, but then my dad said, 'Wait, look!' Suddenly, a part of the 'rock' moved and I realized it was a giant cat. I was shocked because I couldn't see it at all before it moved. It has thick, grey fur that blends into the background perfectly. It looks like it’s wearing an invisibility cloak. That moment piqued my curiosity. I want to know more about how they survive in cold places without human help. I also wonder about their long tail and if they use it as a blanket. I read they are endangered, so I’m worried. I want to learn how to protect their habitat. If I can, I want to visit a research center to see more photos. It’s such a mysterious and beautiful creature. I want to learn every detail about their lives and how they hunt in the silent mountains.",
            advanced: "I’d like to recount my fascination with the Snow Leopard, often called the 'Ghost of the Mountains' due to its elusive nature. My obsession began a decade ago while watching a high-definition documentary. I recall a scene where the camera focused on rugged terrain for two minutes. To my eye, it was merely static stones. However, a slight twitch of a tail revealed the majestic predator, and I was breathless. It was a masterclass in natural camouflage. This visual impact is why I’m dying to delve deeper into their world. I’m captivated by their physiological adaptations—how their oversized paws act as snowshoes and their long tails provide balance on cliffs. Beyond physical traits, I find their solitary lifestyle in the hostile Himalayas to be heroic and lonely. I want to understand the drive of a solitary apex predator. I am also deeply concerned about their vulnerable status due to climate change. I want to explore population trends and conservation efforts to mitigate human-wildlife conflict. The idea that such a beautiful creature could vanish is heartbreaking. For me, the Snow Leopard represents the ultimate mystery of nature, and I feel a strong desire to advocate for its protection."

            simple: "Well, to be honest, I’m not a professional swimmer, but scuba diving is at the top of my bucket list. I’ve been interested in this since I saw an ocean movie as a teenager. I’d love to try it in a place where the water is crystal clear, like Thailand or the Great Barrier Reef. I want to see vibrant coral reefs and colorful fish with my own eyes. I think it will be difficult and scary at first. You have to use heavy equipment like an oxygen tank and learn to breathe underwater, which isn't natural. I’ll definitely need professional training. I might feel panic-stricken at the beginning. However, the reason I want to try it is the sense of freedom. I want to feel weightless, like I’m flying in a blue universe. My city life is very noisy, so diving into the silent underwater world would give me tranquility. I want to step out of my comfort zone and see what the world looks like under the sea. I guess it will be an exhilarating and unforgettable experience. I’m planning to save money and take a diving course next summer. I hope I can overcome my fear of deep water.",
            advanced: "A water sport that has occupied the summit of my bucket list is scuba diving. Ideally, I’d like to take the plunge in the Great Barrier Reef, a location renowned for staggering biodiversity. The prospect of immersing myself in that vibrant world is utterly captivating. I’ve been drawn to the transition from the noisy surface to a silent, deep-blue universe where the only sound is the rhythm of your breathing. Admittedly, scuba diving is not for the faint-hearted. It requires a leap of faith and rigorous training to master equipment and buoyancy. Learning to breathe through a regulator in an alien environment is a formidable challenge. However, that’s why I find it exhilarating. I crave the sensation of being 'weightless'—moving in a way impossible on land. The contrast between my structured life and the unpredictable beauty of the reefs drives my curiosity. I want to witness firsthand the intricate ecosystems most people only see in documentaries. For me, scuba diving represents the ultimate way to step out of my comfort zone. It’s not just about an adrenaline rush; it’s about a profound shift in perspective. To be suspended in crystal-clear water, surrounded by mystery, would be an enlightening experience that stays with me forever."
