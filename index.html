            simple: "I’d like to talk about the snow leopard, a creature that has always fascinated me. I first saw it in a documentary when I was about ten years old. I remember sitting on my sofa, staring at the TV, and for a long time, the screen just showed a pile of grey rocks. Then, all of a sudden, part of the 'rock' moved. It was a snow leopard. \n\nThat moment really piqued my interest because I couldn't believe an animal could hide so perfectly in plain sight. They have this thick, beautiful fur that allows them to blend into the mountains. I want to know more about how they survive in such extreme altitudes. The documentary showed them jumping across huge gaps between cliffs, and it looked so dangerous. I also want to understand their endangered status. Because they live in such remote areas, it's hard for scientists to track them. I want to know what we can do to protect their natural habitat from climate change. Every time I think about this 'Ghost of the Mountains', I feel a sense of mystery. I hope to learn more about their daily lives and how they hunt in the silent snow.",
            advanced: "I'd like to describe the snow leopard, an animal that is often referred to as the 'Ghost of the Mountains' due to its incredibly elusive nature. My obsession with this feline began years ago while watching a high-definition nature documentary. I vividly recall a scene where the camera focused on a rugged, snowy terrain for nearly a minute. To my untrained eye, it was just a landscape of stones and shadows, but then, a slight twitch of a tail revealed a majestic leopard. It was a masterclass in camouflage. \n\nThis visual impact is precisely why I’m dying to know more about them. I’m particularly interested in their physiological adaptations—how their oversized paws act like natural snowshoes and how they use their massive tails for balance on sheer cliffs. Beyond their physical traits, I want to explore their solitary lifestyle. Living as an apex predator in the silent, hostile environment of the Himalayas seems both heroic and incredibly lonely. Furthermore, I’m concerned about their vulnerable status. I’d love to delve deeper into the conservation efforts being made to mitigate human-wildlife conflict. The idea that such a stealthy, beautiful creature could vanish forever is heartbreaking. I want to understand the data behind their population trends and what specific measures can be taken to ensure they continue to roam the peaks in silence."

            simple: "I want to talk about a time I had to search for information very urgently. It happened last winter when I was writing my final history report. It was about 11 PM, and the deadline was midnight. Suddenly, all the lights went out—a total blackout. My heart sank because my laptop was low on battery and the Wi-Fi was gone. \n\nI had to use my smartphone and mobile data to search for some last-minute historical facts. I was sitting in the dark, with only the light from my phone screen. I was racing against the clock. Before the blackout, I was feeling relaxed, but now I was so stressed that my hands were shaking. I needed that information because my report wouldn't be complete without the correct dates. I sifted through many websites to find reliable data. After about 20 minutes of frantic searching, I finally found what I needed and uploaded my work just five minutes before the deadline. When the power finally came back an hour later, I was already in bed, feeling a huge sense of relief. It made me realize how much I depend on technology.",
            advanced: "I’d like to recount a high-stakes situation where I had to search for information under extreme pressure. It was during my final semester, just hours before a major academic deadline. I was finishing a complex analysis on economic trends when a sudden blackout plunged my entire neighborhood into darkness. The silence was deafening, and my immediate thought was about the 15% battery life remaining on my devices. \n\nI was forced to rely entirely on my smartphone to search for the specific statistical models I needed to conclude my paper. The contrast between my calm, organized research session earlier that day and this frantic race against the clock was jarring. I remember hunched over in the pitch-black room, my eyes straining against the blue light of the screen, desperately typing search queries. I had to sift through a vast amount of fragmented information to filter out irrelevant data. I eventually turned to an AI-powered search tool to streamline the process, which was a total game-changer. It synthesized the complex data into manageable points, allowing me to finish the work. The urgency of the situation forced me to be more efficient than I’ve ever been. When I finally hit the 'submit' button, the adrenaline was still pumping. That night was an enlightening reminder of our vulnerability in the digital age."

I had forgotten my umbrella, and I was standing at the school gate, feeling quite miserable. Leo walked up to me—he was a quiet boy in my class—and offered to share his umbrella. We walked to the bus station together, and that’s how we struck up a friendship. \n\nLeo is important to me because he is a very reliable person. Last year, I was going through a very tough time because I failed my driving test three times. I felt like a loser. Leo didn't tell me 'it’s okay' or give me a boring speech. Instead, he took me to an empty parking lot every weekend and helped me practice for hours. He was so patient, even when I made the same mistakes again and again. He’s a man of few words, but his actions speak louder than anything else. He’s the person I go to whenever I have a problem because I know he will give me honest and invaluable advice. I really cherish our friendship because he has seen me at my best and my worst, and he’s still standing by me.",
            advanced: "I’d like to describe Leo, someone I consider a kindred spirit and a cornerstone of my life. Our paths first crossed during a gloomy, rain-soaked afternoon in high school. I was stranded at the entrance without an umbrella, watching the crowds disappear, when Leo—an introverted classmate I’d barely spoken to—offered to share his. That shared walk to the station was the beginning of a bond that has now spanned over half a decade. \n\nWhat makes Leo indispensable to me isn't just our shared history, but his unwavering support during my darkest moments. He possesses this rare quality of being a man of few words but immense action. I recall a period last year when I was drowning in academic pressure and personal self-doubt. While others offered superficial encouragement, Leo was there to provide a shoulder to cry on and practical solutions. He would sit with me in silence for hours, just to ensure I didn't feel alone. This contrast between his quiet demeanor and his fierce loyalty is what I admire most. He doesn't just listen; he hears what I’m not saying. His influence on me has been profound, teaching me the value of patience and true reliability. Our friendship has survived various personality clashes and life changes, and I honestly can’t imagine navigating my twenties without his steady presence by my side."

It’s not a natural thing for humans to do, so I’ll definitely need professional training. However, the reason I’m so keen to try it is the sense of freedom it offers. I want to feel weightless, like I’m flying through the water. I’ve seen pictures of vibrant coral reefs and thousands of colorful fish, and I want to see them with my own eyes instead of just on a screen. Currently, my life is very busy and noisy, so I think diving into the silent underwater world would give me a lot of tranquility.

The prospect of immersing myself in that vibrant, underwater world is something I find utterly exhilarating. \n\nAdmittedly, scuba diving isn't a sport you can just jump into; it requires a leap of faith and rigorous professional training. Mastering the equipment and learning to maintain buoyancy while breathing through a regulator is a significant physical and mental challenge. However, that’s precisely why I’m drawn to it. I’ve always been captivated by the idea of being 'weightless'—experiencing a form of movement that is impossible on land. The contrast between the chaotic, noisy world we live in and the absolute tranquility of the deep blue sea is what I crave. I want to move past the surface and witness the intricate ecosystems of coral reefs firsthand. For me, it’s not just about the adrenaline rush; it’s about a profound shift in perspective. Stepping out of my comfort zone to explore a silent, alien environment would be an enlightening experience that I’m sure would stay with me for a lifetime."

            simple: "I want to share a famous Chinese traditional story called 'The Legend of the White Snake'. My grandmother told me this story when I was a little girl. It was a cold winter night, and I remember sitting by her side as she described the beautiful West Lake in Hangzhou. \n\nThe story is about a white snake that transforms into a beautiful woman and falls in love with a young man named Xu Xian. They get married and are very happy, but a monk named Fahai thinks their love is wrong because she is not human. He tries everything to separate them and finally traps the White Snake under a pagoda. When I first heard this story, I felt very sad and angry at the monk. I couldn't understand why he wanted to destroy such a beautiful relationship. I was only seven, so I cried for the characters. Now that I’m older, I realize the story is symbolic. It’s about fighting for love even when the whole world is against you. This story has been passed down through generations in China and it’s a big part of our cultural heritage. It’s still very popular today in movies and operas.",
            advanced: "I’d like to recount a cornerstone of Chinese folklore known as 'The Legend of the White Snake'. This captivating tale was first introduced to me by my grandmother as a bedtime story. I recall being mesmerized by her vivid descriptions of misty rain on the Broken Bridge in Hangzhou—a setting that felt almost mythological under her narration. \n\nThe narrative centers on a supernatural romance between a white snake spirit and a mortal man. Their forbidden love, however, is met with fierce opposition from a powerful monk who represents rigid tradition and prejudice. The conflict reaches a climax when the heroine is imprisoned beneath a pagoda, separated from her family. When I first heard this, it struck a deep emotional resonance within me. As a child, I was heartbroken by the injustice of their separation, but as an adult, I appreciate the story's complexity. It’s deeply rooted in our culture because it explores the tension between individual desire and social boundaries. The White Snake isn't just a monster; she is a symbol of sacrifice and the indomitable human spirit. This story has survived for centuries because its moral of the story—that love should transcend boundaries—is universal. It remains an iconic piece of our cultural heritage, continuing to inspire countless modern adaptations."
